Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is a branch of computer science used for the desig,deveopment ,testing,deployment and maintenance of software.
high quality and reliable software
performance and scalability-it enables us to have software that can handle alot without trading in performance
efficiency-software engineering enabes us  to reduce the amount of time spent and money on constantly maintaininng old unreliabe software  

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The beginnings of high level software engineering-during this period programmers were introduced to high level programming languages such as Fortran and Cobol 
The creation of internets and web development-the creation of networks has been a cornerstones of how we approach software development in terms of web development
The rise of AI in society-AI has become a cultural phenomenom and the backboneof AI is software engineering



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
initiation-project goals and objectives are defined
planning-during this phase a development plan is created and resources and risks are evaluated
execution-development plans are implemented 
monitoring and controlling-during this phase the progress of the project is evauated and quality control procedures are implemented
closure-all project activites are finalised and important resources partaining the project are stored


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall
-sequential :in waterfall approach is taken to the project meaning you can't move on to the next phase without finishing the current phase
-testing:testing is only done after the entire project is complete
-risk:because testing only happens after project completion the risk of failure is high
-flexibility-there is little to no flexibiity because everything is done on a strict plan
scenario: can be used when dealing with a project that requires minimal changes such as developing something uncomplicated and easy to use such as a calculator

agile
-iterative and incremental:meaning the project is done in increments or parts  
-testing:testing is done regurlarly to each increment or part,testing and development are done at the same time
-risk:risk is extremely low because testing is done every step of the way so if there are any problemsthey are fixed way before the entire project is completed
-flexibility-highly flexible
scenario:best used for projects with constant changes to the requirements such as a social media app


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer
-they are responsible for the building ,testing and maintaining software 
-they work in collaboration with other members of their team to achieve overall great results across all fronts
-they are there to offer their proffesional input when it comes to matters partaining to software

Quality assurance engineer
-they are responsible for ensuring the quality of the software being developed
-they are responsible for testing the software to ensure that it functions as it should 
-they collaborate closely with developers 
-they are also rwesponsible for ensuring that the software meets all specified requirements

project manager
-they are responsible for creating a project plan that clearly defines what the goals and objectives of the software are
-they are responsible for oversseing that all aspects of the project are proceeding as intended
-they work closely with clients to fullu understand what their goals with the software are


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
intergrated development environments and version control systems are important in the software dvelopmet process because they improve efficiency and productivity by having code assistanceamd debugging tools to maake the jobs of the developers easy while version control systems on the other hand contribute to collaboration amongst team members and easy tracking of current and past versions of software 
examples of ide's: codeblocks,visual studio code,jupypiter notebook
examples of vcs: Git,CVS


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
time constraints-this is due to tight deadlines and big workloads ,solution: improved time management in all aspects of the project 
security concerns-this is due to ever increasing cyber threats,solution:invest more resources into the cyber security department
constantly changing requirements:-this is due to evolving demands,solution:adapt by using agile development methodologies

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit-tests each piece ,making they all work properly individually irrespective of every other part.importance: it is essential for early error detection and simplified debugging
intergration-makes sure that all the components interact with each other as they should together.importance:it reveals interface issues if there are any
system-tests that the entire software as a whole functions properly.importance:assesses overall performance of the software as a whole
acceptance-whether the software meets the intended requirements is evaluated and whether or not it is ready to be handed over to the client.importance:ensures that they won't be any problems with the software after it has been handed over to the client.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of creating clear and specific instructions or questions  to get the best answers from AI models
Prompt engineering is important because it allows us to obtain better and clearer answers from the models,it also enables us to maximise the potential of what the AI model can do for us as users thus it improves user experience and improves user productivity

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
a vague prompt: "Write a poem"
a better prompt would be :"Write me a poem about a scared little girl,make it three lines long ",this is better because it is not as vague amd it gives more concise information about what exactly we want
